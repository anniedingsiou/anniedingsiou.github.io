    	If you do not own an iPhone meaning that you do not have AirDrop you should definitely check Snapdrop out. Open the webpage both on your laptop and phone (the website will automatically connect the devices), drop the files you want to transfer, and they will appear on the other device ready to be downloaded. Easy!
